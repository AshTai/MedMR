  y_type = "discrete",
  method = "Robust",
  scale = "difference",

\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame, where the column is the variable and row is the sample.}

\item{exposure}{variable name of the exposure.}

\item{mediators}{variable names of mediators.}

\item{outcome}{variable name of the outcome.}

\item{confounder}{variable names of confounders.}

\item{m_type}{a description of the mediator model. This should be one of "d" (logistic model), "normal" (Gaussian model), "exp" (exponential model), and "poisson" (poisson model).}

\item{y_type}{a description of the outcome model. "discrete" uses logistic model, and "continuous" uses Gaussian model.}

\item{method}{a description of the estimation method. "IPW" stands for the inverse probability weighting; "G" stands for G-computation; "Robust" stands for multiply robust estimation. Default is "Robust".}

\item{boot}{a logical value. if 'TRUE' nonparametric bootstrap will be used for SD estimation. Default is 'FALSE'.}

\item{boot_ratio}{a ratio of the random samples of individuals from the original data.}

\item{boot_rep}{a number of replicates}

\item{seed_num}{seed. Default is 123.}

\item{double_mont}{a number of Monte Carlo simulations in multiply robust estimation.}

\item{single_mont}{a number of Monte Carlo simulations in G-computation.}

\item{b_rep}{if true resampling with replacement will be used; if false resampling without replacement will be used.}
}
\value{
A list of estimated direct, indirect, and total effects.
TE is the total effect. Seq0 is the natural direct effect.
Seq1,...SeqK are the natural indirect effects of mediators.
}
\description{
MedMR is used to assess the natural indirect effects with multiple mediators by multiply robust estimation, G-computation, and inverse probability weighting.
